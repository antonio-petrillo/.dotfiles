#+title: Readme

* Just a basic config
The most part is stolen from [[Distro Tube][Distro Tube]], I just removed the theming section because I use pywal.
To use pywal colorscheme, as it written in [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Getting-Started][github wiki]], I only need to add the following line to my ~bashrc~:
#+begin_src shell
(cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences &)
#+end_src
