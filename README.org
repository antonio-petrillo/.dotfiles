* My dotfiles
What is in there:
+ Xmonad & Xmobar config
+ dunst
+ alacritty
+ pywal
+ picom
+ tmux
+ .bashrc
+ rofi
+ some wallpaper
+ Emacs (Doom)
* TODO In order of importance
1. add pacman hook to autorecompile xmonad, so I don't need to bestemmiare
2. add a file description, and a script, for every symlink to automate the creation of correct symlink (the one that are there now are just placeholder)
3. Setup rofi to use pywal colorscheme
4. Improve xmonad literate config and xmobar config
5. Add Doom literate config
6. Add Install script (only to install needed package)
7. Add files to gitignore
8. Add script to change wallpaper and sync all colorscheme accordingly to pywal
9. eww widget (notif-center, dashboard, systray (there are some alternative to use with xmobar,  but I didn't really like them (this todo is kinda lispy (but in reverse))))
10. Explain why I think that ~awesomeWM~ is better, but is to complicated to setup and that bring me back to XMonad (long story short: "Too much code to write, to much depencies (Bling, Rubato, Lain, ecc... )")
11. Rewrite my own emacs config (a very basic config, to alternate with Doom)
12. Try out NixOs
