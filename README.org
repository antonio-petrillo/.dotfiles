* My dotfiles
What is in there:
+ Xmonad & Xmobar config
+ dunst
+ alacritty
+ pywal
+ picom
+ tmux (I don't use it very much)
+ .bashrc
+ rofi
+ some wallpaper
+ Emacs (Doom)

* TODO [6/10] In order of importance
1. [X] [TOIMPROVE] add a file description, and a script, for every symlink to automate the creation of correct symlink (need some more test)
2. [X] Setup rofi to use pywal colorscheme
3. [X] Improve xmonad literate config and xmobar config
4. [ ] Add Doom literate config
5. [X] Add Install script (partially done, need some test and refiniture)
6. [X] Add files to gitignore
7. [X] Add script to change wallpaper and sync all colorscheme accordingly to pywal, only for Xmonad
8. [ ] eww widget (notif-center, dashboard, systray (there are some alternative to use with xmobar,  but I didn't really like them (this todo is kinda lispy (but in reverse))))
9. [ ] Rewrite my own emacs config (a very basic config, nothing fancy)
